# BioSignals
BioSignals is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platfrom.
The goal of the project is to offer an efficient and automated biosignal processing routine based on [pyphysio](https://github.com/MPBA/pyphysio) - a python library
developed by [Andrea Bizzego](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019301839).

The package reinforces the existing pyhton code with datagroks' [visualization](https://datagrok.ai/help/visualize/viewers) and [data processing](https://datagrok.ai/help/transform/add-new-column) tools. The pipeline itself is designed with scientific 
community in mind, standartizing and thus facilitating the usual ECG,EEG,EDA,etc. signal processing workflows. The fusion of manual and automated steps is largely enabled
by our [intercative viewers](https://datagrok.ai/help/visualize/viewers), [scripting](https://dev.datagrok.ai/help/develop/scripting) capabilities, [detector](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/how-to/add-info-panel) functions and native [scientific methods](https://datagrok.ai/help/learn/data-science).   

Currently the project is in its early stages and we welcome you to contirbute to this repository. 

# Pyphysio
[Pyphysio](https://github.com/MPBA/pyphysio) is a library that contains the implementations of the most important algorithms for the analysis of physiological data.
The latter methods are divided into the following categories:

* **estimators**: from a signal produce a signal of a different type;
* **filters**: from a signal produce a filtered signal of the same type;
* **indicators**: from a signal produce a value;
* **segmentation**: from a signal produce a series of segments;
* **tools**: from a signal produce arbitrary data;

# A unique approach to every signal
Key signal types:

* [ECG](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.93.5.1043): heartbeat data;
* [EDA](https://www.biopac.com/wp-content/uploads/EDA-SCR-Analysis.pdf): electro-dermal activity;
* [EEG](https://www.kiv.zcu.cz/site/documents/verejne/vyzkum/publikace/technicke-zpravy/2013/tr-2013-02.pdf): brain activity;

Since various signals require a different combination of filters and information extraction steps,
a separate pipeline has to be designed for every input. We plan to first separately recreate the 
recommended workflows and then combine them to form a complete package. 

# Automation
A substantial part of this project targets improvements to user-friendliness. Our goal is to create a smart
environment, which streamlines the pre-processing steps by autonomously selecting and suggesting the most 
appropriate tools.

### Detectors.js
A file containing functions for preliminary data analysis. Once any table is uploaded to the platform,
this script decides whether the BioSignals package should be added to the 'Algorithms' list. Currently,
the mechanism relies on column labels, however its functionality can be extended to rely on actual data.

### Types of auto-input
By design all the inputs could be split into three sub-types:

* **User input:** completely manual (for areas where no inferences from the data can be made);
* **Auto suggest:** completely automated (input suggestions inferred from the data);
* **Auto Limit:** automatically limit the options, given previous choices;
