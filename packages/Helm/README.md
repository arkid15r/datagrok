# HELM

Provides support for [HELM notation](https://pistoiaalliance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HELM/overview) 
(Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules) -
a single notation that can encode the structure of complex biomolecules including diverse polymers, 
non-natural monomers and complex attachment points.
