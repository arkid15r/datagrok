  description: "The U.S. Department of Education's My Brother’s Keeper APIs provide access to several datasets compiled by the My Brother's Keeper Task Force, who gathered indicators from a range of federal data sources to support analyses of important life outcomes for all youth, including boys and young men of color. Specifically, these APIs provide information on 18- to 24-year-olds by race/ethnicity and sex, including high school dropout rates; college enrollment and graduation rates; rates of disconnected youth (who are neither working nor in school); imprisonment rates; and labor force participation rates."
