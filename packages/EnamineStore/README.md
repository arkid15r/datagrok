EnamineStore is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) 
platform that provides integration with the [Enamine Store](https://enaminestore.com), a service for online
shopping for the chemical building blocks.

There are two ways to use it: as an [application](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#applications),
or as an [info panel](https://datagrok.ai/help/discover/infopanels) for chemical structures. 
 
# Application

The application allows to search the Enamine Store, and show result in the table view.
