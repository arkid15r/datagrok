# OligoBatchCalculator

OligoBatchCalculator calculates the following oligonucleotide properties:
1. Length
2. Optical Density
3. NMoles
4. Mass
5. Molecular Weight
6. Extinction Coefficient (using nearest neighbour method)

To calculate these properties, paste your sequences into input text field, specify amount and units. 
Click "SAVE AS CSV" to export calculations.

If some symbols in sequences are not recognized, they will be painted red, and "REMOVE ERRORS" button will appear, press 
it button to remove painted symbols, or correct mistakes manually.

All supported sequence representations are listed [here](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/SequenceTranslator#sequence-representations).
