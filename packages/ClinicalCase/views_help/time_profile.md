### Time profile

This view contains line chart which allows to evaluate laboratory dynamics in time. X axis is time axis showing days of study. Y axis is biomarker level scale. 

There are 2 types of chart representation:

- Non-normalized biomarkers results
- Relative changes from baseline

Type of graph and required visits can be selected in the ribbon panel above chart.

Line chart is splitted by treatment arm by default. But parameter to split by can be changed as well as biomarker itself.

Each value on the line is drawn in form of distribution. By default points represents median, whiskers represent upper and lower quartiles. Type of distribution can also be changed in property panel.
