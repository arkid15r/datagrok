### Correlation matrix

Correlation matrix showing relations between biomarkers values for all subjects at the selected visit.

On diagonal you can see histograms showing biomarker distribution. Cells at the intersection of certain biomarkers contains correlation coefficient for that pair of biomarkers. By hovering mouse over correlation coefficient you will see scatter plot with corresponding biomarkers values in a tooltip.

By default correlation matrix is created for whole list of biomarkers at the earliest study visit. Visit as well as biomarkers can be further changed via dropdown list and settings button above the boxplots.
