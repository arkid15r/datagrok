# Contributor's Guide

## Code Style

In this public repo we adhere to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). We would strongly appreciate your contributing code style consistency and adherence!

We are not strict about [braces for code blocks of a single statement](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-braces-all) and [trailing commas](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#features-arrays-trailing-comma).

If you use WebStorm IDE, we recommend you to stick to its defaults for JS formatting, except for the spaces settings: change its default value of 4 to 2.
