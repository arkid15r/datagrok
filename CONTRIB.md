# Contributor's guide

## Code style

In this public repo, we follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

We would kindly appreciate your contributing code consistency!

We aren't strict about [braces for code blocks of a single statement](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-braces-all) and [trailing commas](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#features-arrays-trailing-comma).

When creating a package, use the `--eslint` flag to get an up-to-date [configuration file](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/tools/package-template/.eslintrc.json).

If you are using WebStorm IDE, we recommend you to stick to its defaults for JS formatting, except for the spaces settings: change its default value of 4 to 2.
