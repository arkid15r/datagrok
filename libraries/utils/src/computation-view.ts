/**
 * Base class for handling Compute models (see https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/help/compute/compute.md).
 * In most cases, the computation is a simple {@link Func}
 * Extend it in cases where a behavior or UI not supported by the {@link FunctionView} is needed.
 *
 * It provides the following functionality out-of-the-box, where each section could be customized:
 * - a structured way to represent input and output parameters: {@link parameters}
 * - generic way to generate UI for inputs, outputs, and interactivity (running the model, etc)
 *   - persisting historical results to the db (via {@link parameters})
 * - export (to Excel and PDF): {@link export}
 * - easy loading of historical runs
 * - routing
 * - entering the real, measured (as opposed to predicted) values manually
 * - notifications for changing inputs, completion of computations, etc: {@link onInputChanged}
 * */
