# Data Wrangling

_Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data cleaning, is the process of transforming 
and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making 
it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics._

All of the data manipulation routines can be recorded, saved as macros, and applied to 
a new dataset. Here are some of the commonly used routines:

* [Add New Column](../dialogs/add-new-column.md)
* [Anonymize Data](../dialogs/anonymize-data.md)
* [Categorize Data](../dialogs/categorize-data.md)
* [Batch Data Editor](../features/batch-edit.md)
* [Change Type](../dialogs/change-type.md)
* [Aggregate Rows](../dialogs/aggregate-rows.md)
* [Compare Tables](../dialogs/compare-tables.md)
* [Extract RegExp](../dialogs/extract-regexp.md)
* [Filter to Column](../dialogs/filter-to-column.md)
* [Join Tables](../dialogs/join-tables.md)
* [Impute Missing Values](../dialogs/missing-values-imputation.md)
* [Select Duplicates](../dialogs/select-duplicates.md)
* [Select Missing Values](../dialogs/select-missing-values.md)
* [Select Random Rows](../dialogs/select-random-rows.md)
* [Text to Columns](../dialogs/text-to-columns.md)
