## [Peptides application]

Cheminformatics is an *in silico* discipline serving to handle chemical entities for a number of different purposes:
- generate possible chemical structures [all possible](https://gdb.unibe.ch/downloads/) or with [synthetic rules implementation](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/download/savi_download/);
- storing compounds [collections](https://www.merckgroup.com/en/research/open-innovation/biopharma-open-innovation-portal/open-compound-sourcing.html);
- facilitation of chemists' work via visualization and reaction prediction;
- prediction of physical and chemical properties of the compounds (QSPR) and biological activities of the compounds ([QSAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship));
- [ADMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADME) prediction;
- virtual screening to evaluate the most potent drug candidates.
