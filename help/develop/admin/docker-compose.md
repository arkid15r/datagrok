# Deploy Datagrok using Docker Compose

This document contains instructions for running Datagrok on a regular machine via Docker Compose. This method doesn't require cloud-based hosting. It automatically fetches and runs the needed docker images, and you don't need to set up a local PostgreSQL instance as it is delivered automatically via a PostgreSQL container image. We recommend you this method if you want to jump-start with trying out Datagrok in a local, private machine environment. 

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). If you do not have it, follow these [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your operating system.
2. Ideally, you should have at least 30 GB of free disk space.

## Instructions

1. Create a directory:
   ```
   mkdir datagrok
   cd datagrok
   ```

2. In this folder, create a file `docker-compose.yaml` with the following contents (replace `datagrok/datagrok:1.0.82-75b821b` and `datagrok/cvm:1.0.82-75b821b` with the latest versions which you get from our [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/datagrok)):
    ```yaml
    version: "3"
    services:
      db:
        image: postgres
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        networks:
          datagrok:
            aliases:
              - database
        volumes:
          - datagrok_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      datagrok:
        image: datagrok/datagrok:1.0.82-75b821b
        environment:
          GROK_PARAMETERS: "{\"deployDemo\": false, \"dbServer\": \"database\", \"db\": \"datagrok\", \"dbAdminLogin\": \"postgres\", \"dbAdminPassword\": \"postgres\", \"dbLogin\": \"dg\", \"dbPassword\": \"dg\"}"
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        networks:
          datagrok:
            aliases:
              - datagrok
        volumes:
          - datagrok_data:/home/grok/data
          - datagrok_cfg:/home/grok/cfg
      cvm:
        image: datagrok/cvm:1.0.82-75b821b
        environment:
          GROK_COMPUTE_NUM_CORES: 4
        ports:
          - "5005:5005"
          - "8090:8090"
          - "54321:54321"
        networks:
          datagrok:
            aliases:
              - cvm
    volumes: 
      datagrok_db:
      datagrok_data:
      datagrok_cfg:
    networks:
      datagrok:
    ```

3. To start up Datagrok, run this command:  
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```  
   Datagrok will deploy a new database automatically.

4. Once the server is up and running, the Login page should be available at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

5. After Datagrok is deployed for the first time, you can shut it down using `Ctrl+C`. Alternatively, run the command:
   ```  
   docker-compose down  
   ```  
   All the data will be saved in the persistent storage. If you want to reset Datagrok to factory settings, run the following command instead:  
   ```  
   docker-compose down --volumes  
   ```

   * [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
   * [Deploy Datagrok on a regular machine](deploy-regular.md). This is for the case when a local PostgreSQL instance is already present, and with manual containers management. Recommended for most production environments.
