# Scaling

From its inception, Datagrok was designed to connect millions of users with millions
of datasets, data sources, algorithms, scripts, and applications. Not only it should be
able to handle such volumes, but it should do it fast, and without cluttering the UI.

## Data

By keeping metadata separately from data, and utilizing scalable storage for both of 
them (Postgres for metadata, and S3 for data) Datagrok is capable of storing many
datasets, both in terms of numbers and volume.

## UI

### Data augmentation

### Context-specific functions

### Search
