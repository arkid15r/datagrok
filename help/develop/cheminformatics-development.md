# Cheminformatics Development

As a general-purpose extensible platform for scientific computing, Datagrok provides multiple options for developing custom cheminformatics-related functionality. Depending on your needs, use one or more of the following ones, or come up with your own solution.
For performing one of the typical tasks such as calculating descriptors, substructure or similarity search, finding MCS or performing an R-group analysis, consider using [Grok JS API](#grok-js-api).

For custom client-side computations, consider using either [OpenChemLib.JS](#openchemlib.js), or [RDKit built for WebAssembly](#rdkit-in-webassembly).

For custom server-side computations, a popular option is using 
[RDKit in Python](#rdkit-in-python). Python scripts can be seamlessly embedded into Datagrok via [Scripting](scripting.md).

## Grok JS API

For convenience, some of the commonly used functions are exposed via the [JS API](js-api.md). Use `grok.chem` instance to invoke the methods below. Note that most of them are asynchronous, since behind the scenes they either use a server-side assist, or a browser's separate Web Worker to call [RDKit-JS](https://github.com/rdkit/RDKitjs) functions.

```
substructureSearch(column, pattern, settings = { substructLibrary: true });
similarityScoring(column, molecule, settings = { sorted: false });
diversitySearch(column, metric = METRIC_TANIMOTO, limit = 10);
rGroup(table, column, core);
mcs(column);
descriptors(table, column, descriptors);
```

The two first functions, `substructureSearch` and `similarityScoring`, are currently made client-based, using [RDKit-JS](https://github.com/rdkit/RDKitjs) library. We are planning to support both server-side and browser-side modes for these functions in the future, while the API remains as described below.

### Substructure Search

`substructureSearch(column, pattern = null, settings = { substructLibrary: true })`

This function performs substructure search using the corresponsing facilities of RDKit, and returns a result as a Datagrok [BitSet](js-api.md#bitset), where the i-th bit is set to 1 when the i-th element of the input `column` contains a substructure given by a `pattern`, and all other bits there are set to 0.

`column` is a column of type String containing molecules, each in any notation RDKit-JS [supports](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Code/MinimalLib/minilib.h): smiles, cxsmiles, molblock, v3Kmolblock, and inchi. Same applies to a `pattern`: this can be a string representation of a molecule in any of the previous notations.

The `settings` object allows passing the following parameters:

* `substructLibrary`: a boolean indicating whether to use the "naive" graph-based search method, using [`get_substruct_match`](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdchem.html) method of RDKit (`substructLibrary: false`), or a [`substructLibrary`](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2018/02/introducing-substructlibrary.html) from RDKit. The default value is `true`.

For the chosen `substructLibrary` method, the first call to the function with a `column` previouly unseen by the `substructureSearch` function shall invoke building a library. The library is used for conducting further searches in the same given column while the `pattern` is varying.

The function's user doesn't need to manage the library, as it is done by the function automatically. As long as the function detects it has received a new column instead of the one previously seen, it will rebuild the library for this newly seen column.

It is possible to call `substructureSearch` solely for initializing the library, without performing an actual search. In order to do this, `pattern` should be passed with a value of either `null` or an empty string `'''`.

Sometimes it happens that the molecule strings aren't supported by RDKit-JS. These inputs are skipped when indexing, but an error log entry is added for each such entry to the browser's console together with the actual molecule string. For such unsupported molecule, the corresponding bit in the bitset remains as 0. Thus, the bitset is *always* of the input `column`'s length.  

### Similarity Scoring

`similarityScoring(column, molecule = null, settings = { sorted: false });`

This function uses [Morgan fingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#morgan-fingerprints-circular-fingerprints) and [Tanimoto similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_similarity) (also known as Jaccard similarity) on computed fingerprints to rank molecules in a `column` by their similarity to a given `molecule`.

Identically to the convention of `substructureSearch`, `column` is a column of type String containing molecules, each in any notation RDKit-JS [supports](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Code/MinimalLib/minilib.h): smiles, cxsmiles, molblock, v3Kmolblock, and inchi. Same applies to a `molecule`: this is a string representation of a molecule in any of the previous notations.

The `settings` object allows passing the following parameters:

* `sorted`: a boolean indicating what type of output to be produced
  * `sorted === false`: one Datagrok [`Column`](https://datagrok.ai/js-api/Column) shall be produced, where the i-th element contains a similarity score for the i-th element of the input `column`
  * `sorted === true`: a Datagrok [`DataFrame`](https://datagrok.ai/js-api/DataFrame) of three columns shall be produced:
    * The 1-st column, named `molecule`, contains the original molecules string representation from the input `column`
    * The 2-nd column, named `score`, contains the corresponding similarity scores of the range from 0.0 to 1.0, and the DataFrame is sorted descending by this column
    * The 3-rd column, named `index`, contains indices of the molecules in the original input `column`

Similarly to the substructure-library based method of `substructureSearch`, this function maintains a cache of pre-computed fingerprints. Once the function `similarityScoring` meets the `column` previously unmet, it builds the cache of computed fingerprints for the molecules of this `column`, and later uses it to compute similarity scores as long as the function is invoked for the same `column`.

To only build (aka prime) this cache without performing an actual search, e.g. in case of pre-computing the fingerprints in the UI, the function should be called passing `molecule` either as `null` or as an empty string `'''`.

Sometimes it happens that the molecule strings aren't supported by RDKit-JS. These inputs are skipped when indexing, but an error log entry is added for each such entry to the browser's console together with the actual molecule string. For such unsupported molecule, the corresponding fingerprint of all zeroes is produced. Thus, the output Column (or DataFrame) is *always* of the input `column`'s length (with the number of rows equal to `column`'s lenth, respectively).

## OpenChemLib.JS

[OpenChemLib.JS](https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js) is a JavaScript port of the 
[OpenChemLib](https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib) Java library. Datagrok currently uses it
for some of the cheminformatics-related routines that we run in the browser, such as
rendering of the molecules, and performing in-memory substructure search. 

Here is an [example of manipulating atoms in a molecule](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/mol-atoms-bonds) using openchemlib.js.

## RDKit in Python

[RDKit in Python](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) are Python wrappers for 
RDKit, one of the best open-source toolkits for cheminformatics. While Python scripts get executed
on a server, they can be seamlessly embedded into Datagrok via [Scripting](scripting.md).  

Here are some RDKit in Python-based [cheminformatics-related scripts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/ChemScripts/scripts/python)
in the public repository.

## RDKit in WebAssembly

Recently, Greg Landrum, the author of RDKit, has introduced 
[a way to compile its C++ code to WebAssembly](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html),
thus allowing to combine the performance and efficiency of the carefully crafted C++ codebase with the ability to
run it in the browser. This approach fits perfectly with Datagrok's philosophy of performing as much 
computations on the client as possible, so naturally we've jumped on that opportunity!

Here is an [example of a package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/RDKitDemo) 
that exposes two functions. One of them, "rdKitInfoPanel", demonstrates how functions can be dynamically
discovered and used as an info panels. Below is the result, the "RDKitInfo" panel on the right
contains the structure that gets rendered as SVG using the RDKit library.
