# Grok Application

A Datagrok application is built on top of the Datagrok platform.

The Datagrok application typically serves a targeted need around a particular problem or area. For example:

* customer-specific applications, such as a bioreactor modeling application or an application for working with and understanding molecular sequence data
* interactive applications and dashboards, such as molecular database browser (see our [Enamine Store application](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/EnamineStore)), a Covid-19 or weather data info panel, etc.
* integration applications, where data from several sources is interpreted and visualised in a coherent way

Datagrok applications are developed in JavaScript / TypeScript using our rich [Datagrok JavaScript API](), with using
any of the [scripting]() languages we support, such as R or Python, via calling scripts.

Application is typically comprised of many UI features of the platform, including [input controls](),
[accordion panes](), [grid viewers](), scatter plots, line charts and many other [viewers](../viewers/scatter-plot.md),
functional features, such as calling Python and R [scripts](../develop/scripting.md), accessing external web services
via [OpenAPI specs]() and [REST API](), and many others.

One [Datagrok package](../develop/develop.md) may contain zero, one or several applications.

# Launching applications

To open the application launcher and see all [available](https://public.datagrok.ai/apps) applications,
follow to `Functions | Apps` from the left-side activity bar, or follow [this link](https://public.datagrok.ai/apps).
To launch a particular app automatically, open the following URL: `https://public.datagrok.ai/apps/<APP_NAME>`,
if there is only one app in the package, or `https://public.datagrok.ai/apps/<PACKAGE_NAME>/<APP_NAME>`,
if there are several. You'd learn the right URL first time you run the app from within the application launcher,
so we recommend you to bookmark it for later use.
