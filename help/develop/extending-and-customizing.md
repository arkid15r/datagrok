# Extending and customizing Datagrok

Datagrok is built highly extensible, composable and customizable. Many parts of the Datagrok platform can be
enhanced by plugins using our [JavaScript API](js-api.md). The plugins are structured and delivered to the platform
using [Datagrok packages](develop.md#packages). Many features of the platform, such as a
[Timelines](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Viewers) or
[Sunburst](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Sunburst) viewers,
as well as a [Cheminformatics package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chem),
are already built as plugins. It is straightforward to create your own ones,
using the [existing packages](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages) as examples, and
following our [guides](develop.md), [API samples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js), [how-to's](how-to/develop-custom-viewer.md), and [exercises](exercises.md).

Both the existing extensions and your own-made ones are intended highly customizable. For instance,
look at some properties of the [grid viewer](visualize/viewers/grid.md), where you can set which tooltips
to display, which grid lines to present, and even add [conditional color coding](visualize/viewers/grid.md#color-coding)! Datagrok also provides for introducing your own [custom properties]() specific to your plugins.

## What can be extended

With using our [JavaScript API](js-api.md), you can create your own:

* [functions](overview/functions/function.md), which may be written in any [scripting language we support]
  (develop/scripting.md), and later be reused in various contexts, including other functions, or called directly
  from Datagrok UI or the [console](overview/navigation.md#console)  
* [visualizations (viewers)](visualize/viewers.md) — to view data in new ways, in addition to our 30+ viewers
* [file viewers](develop/how-to/custom-file-viewers.md) — to support new data formats in addition to many
  we already recognize
* [cell renderers](visualize/viewers/grid.md#custom-cell-renderers) — to visualize certain semantic types,
  such as [molecules](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Chem/src/rdkit_cell_renderer.js) or [nucleotide sequences](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Sequence/web-logo-viewer),
  in their native-looking renders, inside contexts such as a grid cell, a tooltip, or an axis label in a viewer
* [semantic type detectors](develop/how-to/define-semantic-type-detectors.md) — to attach semantic types to columns of particular data types to later re-use this knowledge
* Web [applications](develop/how-to/build-an-app.md) focused on specific tasks, such as an interactive dashboard
  or a data set browser, as [the one for Chembl](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/ChemblBrowser)
* menus, which may be embed into virtually any context inside the Datagrok UI, such as a
  [top menu](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/ui/menu) or a [context menu](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/events/viewer-events) of a viewer
* [info panels](develop/how-to/build-info-panel.md), which augment datasets with all possible kinds of computable
  information based on the original dataset contents
* [connections](access/data-connection.md), to add new public or in-house data sources to the Datagrok instance,
  such as [Chembl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) or [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/),
* custom [filters](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Widgets/src/filters/radio_button_filter.js),
  which allow adding a filtering mask to an active dataset; in addition, viewers themselves may act as filters,
  and filtering through one viewer shall reflect the state in all the other active viewers
* [accordion sections](develop/ui.md#accordions) — accordion is an area on the left of the Datagrok UI,
  useful for additional custom functionality
  
You could spot other aspects in Datagrok that allow for customization while getting introduced to the platform.

## What can be customized

Beside a regular CSS-based customization, here are some of the things which you can customize both programmatically and through the UI:

* Every viewer exposes a diverse set of [properties](overview/navigation.md#properties), accessible on the right side in the Datagrok's
  `Property Panel`. Often you need to modify these properties programmatically. The mapping is straightforward: take the property's name,
  say, `"Col Header Height"`, modify it to the camel case: `colHeaderHeight`, and apply the property to your viewer via `.setOptions`.
  Say, for the grid `grid` call `grid.setOptions({ colHeaderHeight: 50 });`. Read more about this
  [here](develop/how-to/develop-custom-viewer.md)
  
* You can control the platform's shell aspects programmatically. Study [this sample](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/shell/ui-parts)
  to learn how to hide the Datagrok's sidebar or the toolbox, which is often useful in the [Datagrok applications](develop/how-to/build-an-app.md)
  
* Use features like [conditional color coding](https://dev.datagrok.ai/js/samples/grid/color-coding-conditional) for making
  your views appear indicative to the data they exhibit

* Use the [dock system](develop/how-to/manipulate-viewers.md#docking-viewers) and [custom views](develop/how-to/custom-views.md)
  to provide for completely custom layouts composed inside the Datagrok platform, tailored to your specific use cases. Learn
  more about Datagrok's composable UI [here](develop/ui.md)

## Get started

Let's get a feel of plugin development with a simple extension which embeds to Datagrok as an
[info panel](develop/how-to/build-info-panel.md) displaying some simple statistics for a text in a selected grid cell.

### Create a package

If you haven't already set up your local development environment, go though the steps described [in this article](develop/develop.md#getting-started).

Let's create a package:
 ```
 grok create TextStats
 ```
This creates a folder `TextStats` with the package structure in it.

The package may contain one or more plugins, such as [info panels](), [viewers](),
[scripts]() and [functions](), [cell renderers](), one or several [Datagrok applications](),
and so forth.

For the newly created package, it's relevant to restore its dependencies, that's typical for any `webpack` package.
Get into your `TextStats` folder and do:

```
npm install
```

### The panel function

Add the actual panel's code at `TextStats/src/package.js`:

```
//name: Text Stats
//tags: panel, widgets
//input: string str
//output: widget result
textStats(str) {
  // for 'gattaca', produces {"g": 1, "a": 3, "t": 2, "c": 1}
  const symbolCounts = Array.from(str).reduce((counts, ch) => {
    counts[ch] = (counts[ch] || 0) + 1;
    return counts;
  }, Object.create(null));
  return new DG.Widget(ui.divV([
    ui.divText("Counting characters:"),
    ui.divText(`${JSON.stringify(symbolCounts)}`)
  ]));
}
```

That's it! What creates a panel is this function plus the annotation contained in the comments preceding it.
Datagrok recognizes these comments and makes the function `textStats` become a `panel` producing a `widget`,
taking a `string` as an input.

### Deploy the plugin

What's left is to deploy the package with your first plugin and see it in action.

Inside your `TextStats` package folder, do what's typically done for a regular `webpack` package:

```
webpack
grok publish public

```

The return code should be `0` to indicate a successful deployment.

Now go to Datagrok and open any data file with string columns. This could be a `demog` dataset from our demo datasets.
Navigate to a text cell and find your freshly added panel with text stats on the right side of Datagrok UI.

We have completed the deployment. Let's navigate to `Manage | Packages` and find your package in the list. Note it has
your name prefixed with a `v.`, which means it's only published for you. This is called a Debug mode. To make it
available to the user or a group of interest, you can `Share` it to the group via right-click menu on the package.
Don't forget to publish the package as `grok publish public --release`: this now makes this package _released_
for these groups of interest.

### Overview of the API

[This document](develop/js-api.md) gives a great overview of our JS API, skim through it
to get an idea, it isn't long. In general, there are three entry points to the API:  **grok** for easy discoverability of the functionality,  **ui** for building user interfaces, and  **DG** for instantiating classes directly. You'd find them included in `src/package.js`.

### Overview of the examples

The great source of what Datagrok can do is available here:
[https://public.datagrok.ai/js](https://public.datagrok.ai/js) under "JavaScript API Examples".
This will become your daily source of knowledge about many aspects of the platform. You'd
run these examples in our JS Fiddler, which supports `async/await` and IntelliSense, immediately getting results in the platform.

The more complex examples are at our public repo: [https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public). Find there [custom viewers](), [custom cell renderers](), and so forth. Use built-in github search to navigate, searching by the inclusions
of `tags` may be very useful for your needs!
