# Custom Viewers

## Development

There are two major alternatives for developing viewers on Datagrok. The first one is JavaScript-based development, which lets you create interactive viewers via [Datagrok JavaScript API](../js-api.md). The second option would be utilizing visualizations available for popular programming languages, such as Python, R, or Julia. This implementation uses [scripting](../scripting.md) internally, so the code runs on the server, which slightly affects interactivity. Nonetheless, both options are applicable and support the essential functionality, such as data filtering and selection.

Typically, development starts with [package](../develop.md#packages) creation. Packages are convenient units for distributing content within the platform. Using them you can extend Datagrok with your widgets, applications, plugins, and more. Besides, scripting viewers must be part of a package in order to run their code in a separate environment.

### JavaScript-Based Viewers

Let's create an `Awesome` viewer for your package. This can be done in two simple steps. First, we need to define a subclass of `JsViewer` in a separate file:

```javascript
export class AwesomeViewer extends DG.JsViewer {
    /* AwesomeViewer contents */
}
```

The naming convention assumes that you would add a `Viewer` postfix for such a class. Once this class is added, you can refer to it in the main JavaScript file of your package: 

```javascript
import { AwesomeViewer } from './awesome-viewer.js'

//name: Awesome
//description: Creates an awesome viewer
//tags: viewer
//output: viewer result
export function awesome() {
    return new AwesomeViewer();
}
```

The annotated function above [registers](#registering-viewers) our viewer and makes it available on the platform.

Now we will start adding new functionality to this template. If you have [datagrok-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datagrok-tools) installed and want to follow along, you can obtain the `Awesome` viewer code used for illustration with these commands:

```
grok create AwesomePackage
grok add viewer AwesomeViewer
grok publish --rebuild
```

In case you are new to package development workflow, [this article](../develop.md) will get you started. The code provided here can be found in our [JavaScript API Samples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/functions/custom-viewers/viewers) as well.

Finally, if you would like to explore the methods discussed in the article on your own, jump right to our [JavaScript API documentation](https://datagrok.ai/js-api/JsViewer).

#### Properties

First and foremost, let's take a look at how we can define properties of a viewer. They will include all the parameters you want users to be able to tweak from the UI in the [property panel](../../overview/navigation.md#properties), be it data to display, color scheme, or some numeric values.

```javascript
class AwesomeViewer extends DG.JsViewer {

    constructor() {
        super();

        // Register properties and define fields initialized to properties' default values
        this.question = this.string('question', 'life');
        this.answer = this.int('answer', 42);

        // Properties that represent columns should be strings with the 'ColumnName' postfix
        this.valueColumnName = this.string('valueColumnName', null);
        this.registerCleanup(ui.tools.handleResize(this.root, (w, h) => this.render()));
    }

}
```

In the class `constructor`, you can create properties of the following data types:

  * integer number `this.int(propertyName[, defaultValue])`
  * floating point number `this.float(propertyName[, defaultValue])`
  * string `this.string(propertyName[, defaultValue])`
  * string array `this.stringList(propertyName[, defaultValue])`
  * boolean value `this.bool(propertyName[, defaultValue])`
  * datetime `this.dateTime(propertyName[, defaultValue])`

Follow the naming conventions for JavaScript variables (`lowerCamelCase` will do). Certainly, the names will be nicely displayed in the property panel: capitalized, with spaces between words (e.g., `property` becomes `Property` and `propertyName` becomes `Property Name`). But for them to appear so, pay attention to the names you use in your code. Consistency in naming also ensures that property values are updated correctly.

Properties are divided into two main groups depending on whether they are data-related or not. The first ones belong to the `Data` tab of the property panel, while the rest of them are placed under the `Misc` tab. Add the `ColumnName` postfix to the property name to indicate that it is a data property, otherwise, it will appear in `Misc`. Some properties, such as `stringList` and `dateTime`, can only be used to represent columns.

#### Events

### Scripting Viewers

## Registering Viewers

Tagging scripts or functions as `viewers` registers them within the platform. Registering a viewer makes it available via menu, etc.

    * [PythonScripts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/PythonScripts): contains Python scripts for a number of applications, ranging from plotting to computer vision
    * [RScripts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/RScripts): offers a variety of R visualizations

    Most of these scripts are also available by the `viewers` tag in the script browser: [https://public.datagrok.ai/scripts?q=%23viewers](https://public.datagrok.ai/scripts?q=%23viewers).
