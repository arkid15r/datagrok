# Custom Viewers

## Development

There are two major alternatives for developing viewers on Datagrok. The first one is JavaScript-based development, which lets you create interactive viewers via [Datagrok JavaScript API](../js-api.md). The second option would be utilizing visualizations available for popular programming languages, such as Python, R, or Julia. This implementation uses [scripting](../scripting.md) internally, so the code runs on the server, which slightly affects interactivity. Nonetheless, both options are applicable and support the essential functionality, such as data filtering and selection.

Typically, development starts with [package](../develop.md#packages) creation. Packages are convenient units for distributing content within the platform. Using them you can extend Datagrok with your widgets, applications, plugins, and more. Besides, scripting viewers must be part of a package in order to run their code in a separate environment.

### JavaScript-Based Viewers

Let's create an `Awesome` viewer for your package. This can be done in two simple steps. First, we need to define a subclass of `JsViewer` in a separate file:

```javascript
export class AwesomeViewer extends DG.JsViewer {
    /* AwesomeViewer contents */
}
```

The naming convention assumes that you would add a `Viewer` postfix for such a class. Once this class is added, you can refer to it in the main JavaScript file of your package: 

```javascript
import { AwesomeViewer } from './awesome-viewer.js'

//name: Awesome
//description: Creates an awesome viewer
//tags: viewer
//output: viewer result
export function awesome() {
    return new AwesomeViewer();
}
```

The annotated function above registers our viewer and makes it available on the platform.

### Scripting Viewers

## Registering Viewers

Tagging scripts or functions as `viewers` registers them within the platform. Registering a viewer makes it available via menu, etc.

    Most of these scripts are also available by the `viewers` tag in the script browser: [https://public.datagrok.ai/scripts?q=%23viewers](https://public.datagrok.ai/scripts?q=%23viewers).
