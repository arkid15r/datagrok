# 2020.05.27 Stable version

## What's new

### JavaScript API changed. Use `datagrok-api` NPM package as a code reference.

Now API have 3 entry points: 
* `DG` contains complete API code
* `grok` is the main entry point to start using API for most of the tasks
* `ui` is for constructing UI

Here is how code changes:
```
grok.t => grok.shell.t
grok.v => grok.shell.v
grok.tables => grok.shell.tables
grok.presentationMode => grok.shell.presentationMode
grok.parseCsv => grok.data.parseCsv
GrokPackage => DG.Package
TYPE_FLOAT => DG.TYPE.FLOAT
```

Please, refer to the [JavaScript examples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js) to migrate your code.
