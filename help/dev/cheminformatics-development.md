# Cheminformatics Development

As a general-purpose extensible platform for scientific computing, Datagrok provides multiple options 
for developing custom cheminformatics-related functionality. Depending on your needs, use one or more
of the following ones, or come up with your own solution.

For performing one of the typical tasks such as calculating descriptors, substructure or similarity search,
finding MCS or performing an R-group analysis, consider using [Grok JS API](#grok-js-api).

For custom client-side computations, consider using either [OpenChemLib.JS](#openchemlib.js), or
[RDKit built for WebAssembly](#rdkit-in-webassembly).

For custom server-side computations, a popular option is using 
[RDKit in Python](#rdkit-in-python). Python scripts can be seamlessly embedded into Datagrok
via [Scripting](../features/scripting.md).    

## Grok JS API

For convenience, some of the commonly used functions are exposed via the [JS API](grok_api.md).
Use `grok.chem` instance to invoke the following methods (most of them are asynchronous, since
behind the scenes they use server-side assist):

```
similaritySearch(column, molecule, metric = METRIC_TANIMOTO, limit = 10, minScore = 0.7);
diversitySearch(column, metric = METRIC_TANIMOTO, limit = 10);
substructureSearch(column, pattern, isSmarts = true);
rGroup(table, column, core);
mcs(column);
descriptors(table, column, descriptors);
```

Examples (see on [github](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/GrokApiExamples/scripts/domains/chem))
* [Calculating descriptors](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/descriptors)
* [Substructure search](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/substructure-search)
* [Similarity search](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/similarity-search)
* [Diversity search](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/diversity-search)
* [Maximum common substructure](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/mcs)
* [R-Group analysis](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/r-group)

## OpenChemLib.JS

[OpenChemLib.JS](https://github.com/cheminfo/openchemlib-js) is a JavaScript port of the 
[OpenChemLib](https://github.com/actelion/openchemlib) Java library. Datagrok currently uses it
for some of the cheminformatics-related routines that we run in the browser, such as
rendering of the molecules, and performing in-memory substructure search. 

Here is an [example of manipulating atoms in a molecule](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/domains/chem/mol-atoms-bonds) using openchemlib.js.

## RDKit in Python

[RDKit in Python](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) are Python wrappers for 
RDKit, one of the best open-source toolkits for cheminformatics. While Python scripts get executed
on a server, they can be seamlessly embedded into Datagrok via [Scripting](../features/scripting.md).  

Here are some RDKit in Python-based [cheminformatics-related scripts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/ChemScripts/scripts/python)
in the public repository.

## RDKit in WebAssembly

Recently, Greg Landrum, the author of RDKit, has introduced 
[a way to compile its C++ code to WebAssembly](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html),
thus allowing to combine the performance and efficiency of the carefully crafted C++ codebase with the ability to
run it in the browser. This approach fits perfectly with Datagrok's philosophy of performing as much 
computations on the client as possible, so naturally we've jumped on that opportunity!

Here is an [example of a package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/RDKitDemo) 
that exposes two functions. One of them, "rdKitInfoPanel", demonstrates how functions can be dynamically
discovered and used as an info panels. Below is the result, the "RDKitInfo" panel on the right
contains the structure that gets rendered as SVG using the RDKit library.
