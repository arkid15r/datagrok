# 3D Scatter Plot

Use 3D scatter plot to plot data points on three axes to show the relationship between three variables. 
Each row in the data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the
columns set on the X, Y, and Z axes. Additionally, you can color-code and size-code points, as well
as display labels next to markers.

Controls:

| []()                      |                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------|

| Mouse Wheel Up or Plus    | Zoom in                |
| Mouse Wheel Down or Minus | Zoom out               |
