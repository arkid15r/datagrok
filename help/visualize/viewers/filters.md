# Filters

A set of controls for quick filtering, selection, and visual assessment of column values.

Each categorical filter group has a search field for filtered values. Click the Search icon to the right of the filter caption to open it. This icon appears when you hover the mouse over the filter.

If you start typing text in the field, the filter will show all values ​​that partially contain this text. But if you typing the words, separating them with a comma, then the filter will show only those values ​​that exactly match the each one.

It is also allowed to paste multi-line text from the clipboard into the search field. In this case, the filter will also display those values ​​that exactly match the each word. To select or deselect only the found values ​​of the category - click the checkbox to the left of the search field. Note that other (not displayed) values ​​of the categories do not change their choice.
