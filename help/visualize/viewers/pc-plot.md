# Parallel Coordinates Plot

Parallel coordinates is a common way of visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing
multivariate data.  
To show a set of points in an n-dimensional space, a backdrop is drawn consisting of n parallel
lines, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a
polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds
to the i-th coordinate of the point.  
This visualization is closely related to time series visualization, except that it is applied to
data where the axes do not correspond to points in time, and therefore do not have a natural order.
Therefore, different axis arrangements may be of interest.  

To change columns, set "Column Names" via the property panel. 
To rearrange columns, drag column name into the desired location.
