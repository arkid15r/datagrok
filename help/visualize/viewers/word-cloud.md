# Word cloud

A word cloud is a graphical representation of word frequency. Any other aggregation function can be
used as well for representing size or color of the particular word. On the example of the
demographics dataset, to visualize races by indicating size as number of subjects, and color as
average age, use the following settings (open up properties by pressing F4 or by clicking on the
gear icon in the top right corner):

Properties:

| []()      |         |
|-----------|---------|
| Word      | RACE    |
| Size      |         |
| Size Aggr | #values |
| Color     | AGE     |
| Color     | avg     |

General:

| []()                  |                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Right click           | Context menu    |
