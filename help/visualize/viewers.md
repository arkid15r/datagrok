# Viewers

A viewer is a visual component associated with a [table](../overview/table.md). Unlike 
other products, our viewers are [super fast](../develop/performance.md#viewers), 
completely interactive, and are capable of handling tens of millions of rows (or millions of columns).

Viewers belonging to the same [view](../overview/table-view.md) all share the same 
row selection and filter. Viewers are saved as part of the [project](../overview/project.md).
Also, it is possible to save viewers and views individually, and reuse them (or 
share with teammates) later on.

## Docking

Viewers are docked within a view. To rearrange it, start dragging viewer's header. Drop zone
indicators will appear; move the mouse cursor to one of them and release the mouse button to 
dock the viewer at that spot. To resize the viewer, drag the viewer's border.

## Selection

All viewers share the same row selection and filtered state, which can be manipulated
in a consistent way across all viewers:

|                  |                 |
|------------------|-----------------|
| ESC              | Deselect all rows and reset filter |
| Ctrl+A           | Select all rows |
| Ctrl+Shift+A     | Deselect all rows |
| Ctrl+Click       | Toggle selected state |
| Shift+Click      | Select point or group |
| Ctrl+Shift+Click | Deselect point or group |

To select rows in the [grid](viewers/grid.md):  

|                                 |                    |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Shift+Mouse Drag                | Select rows        |
| Ctrl+Shift+Mouse Drag           | Deselect rows      |
| Mouse Drag row headers          | Select rows        |
| Shift+drag column headers       | Select columns     |
| Ctrl+click column headers       | Select columns     |
| Ctrl+Shift+click column headers | Deselect columns   |
| (Ctrl+) Shift + ↑↓               | (Un)select rows    |
| (Ctrl+) Shift + ←→              | (Un)select columns |
| (Ctrl+) Shift + mouse-drag       | (Un)select rows    |
| (Ctrl+) Shift + ENTER            | (Un)Select rows with the current value  | 

## Filter

To open filter group, click on the funnel icon in the toolbox:
 
![](viewers/filters-icon.png)

Alternatively, click on the column's "hamburger icon" to filter by individual column:

![](viewers/grid-column-filter.png)

## Select or filter

Use "row source" [property](#properties) to specify which rows should be visualized on the viewer.
To define what happens when user click on a group of rows, use "on click" property and choose
between "filter" and "select".

By setting up these properties, it is possible to create dashboards where one
viewer would serve as a filter to another.   

## Properties

Each viewer has a set of properties associated with it that define either the appearance
(such as "Back Color" or "Font"), or data (such as "Value" or "Split"). The most important
data properties (usually columns to visualize) are exposed as combo boxes on top of the viewer.
To edit the rest of the properties, either click on the "gear" icon on top of the viewer,
or press F4 when the viewer has focus, or right-click and select `Viewer | Propeties`.

## Common actions

Many viewers support the following:

|                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Double-click    | Reset View |
| Alt+drag        | Zoom   |
| Mouse drag      | Pan   |

All of the common actions are available from the context menu. To bring it up, either
right-click, or click on the "hamburger" menu in the top left corner. The icons in the 
viewer header are only visible when the mouse is hovering over the viewer.
 
The following ones are available under the **Viewer** submenu:

|                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Properties      | Show viewer properties in the [property panel](../features/property-panel.md) |
| Clone           | Create a copy of the viewer |
| Full Screen     | Show in full screen. **Alt+F** |
| Close           | Close the viewer |
| Use in Trellis  | Add a [trellis plot](viewers/trellis-plot.md), using this viewer as a renderer |
| Save to Gallery | Saves this viewer to a [gallery](view-layout.md#layout-suggestions) |
| Copy Markup     | Copy viewer settings to the clipboard. It can be pasted as a [Markup](../features/markup.md) |
| Embed           | Create HTML code that can be embedded in an external website |

Style-related commands reside under the **Style** submenu:

|                      |                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Pick up              | Remember the style of the current viewer |
| Apply                | Applies previously remembered style. This option, as well as the "Apply data settings" and "apply style settings", is only enabled when the settings of the corresponding viewer type were picked up previously. |
| Apply Data Settings  | Apply only "Data" section of the settings |
| Apply Style Settings | Apply only "Appearance" section of the settings |
| Set as Default       | Use these settings for new viewers of that type |
| Reset Default        | Clear default settings |

Tooltip-related settings reside under the **Tooltip** submenu:

|                      |                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| Use as Group Tooltip | Use this viewer in for [tooltips that correspond to groups of rows](#group-tooltips) |
| Reset                | Stop using this viewer as a group tooltip |


## Group tooltips

One of the unique features of the Grok platform is the ability to quickly visualize multiple rows
in a tooltip, using the settings of another viewer.  

Once the "Use as Group Tooltip" command is executed, the original viewer is no longer required, 
and it is safe to close it if you choose so.

The following picture illustrates the concept:

If the points are color-coded you can increase the number of displayed variables to three. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. <br> [Scatter Plot](viewers/scatter-plot.md) |
