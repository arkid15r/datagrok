# View Layout

View Layout contains relative positions of [viewers](../viewers/viewers.md) in a [table view](../overview/table-view.md),
along with the viewers' properties. By separating layouts from the actual data displayed, we now can
save current layout (**View | Layout | Save to Gallery**) and later apply it to a different dataset
(**View | Layout | Open Gallery**). 

To clone current view, either do **View | Layout | Clone**, or click on the plus sign on the view header strip, 
and choose **Clone**.

# Viewer Layout

Similarly to view layout, it is possible to reuse the settings of individual [viewers](../viewers/viewers.md).   
Under the 'Viewer' menu (either right-click on the viewer, or click on the 'hamburger' menu on the top left),
you will find the following layout-specific commands:
* Clone
* Save to Gallery

To open a gallery containing viewer and view layout suggestions: **View | Layout | Open Gallery**

## Layout Suggestions

Moreover, the platform will proactively suggest layouts (even created by
other users) to be applied to your data, if a previously saved layout can be used for visualizing currently
opened dataset. The suggestions are based on the popularity and specificity of the layout, as well as on 
the previously observed actions.
 
To check layouts applicable to the current table, open 'Layouts' pane on the left. Alternatively,
open the specialized view/viewer layout suggestion panel: **View | Layout | Open Gallery**
