# Create Project

A project is a collection of different objects that you want to use together. A project can 
contain tables, views, queries, connections, data jobs, Jupyter notebooks, predictive models,
and resources such as files. 

## Sharing Projects

When a project is shared, recipients get access to all objects contained within the project.
To control the privileges, use sharing settings.
