# Variables View

Alt+V opens variables view, which contains all variables available in the current
context, and allows to manipulate them.

There are many ways for an object to appear as a variable:
* Direct assignment like `x = 5` in [console](../features/console.md)
* [Drag-and-drop](../features/drag-and-drop.md) an object to console
* [Drag-and-drop](../features/drag-and-drop.md) an object to a dashboard (this creates a shadow variable)

It is also possible to drag objects out of the variables view.
