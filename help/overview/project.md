# Project

Project is a collection of entities along with the applied visualizations.
Projects are used to group and share data and other assets with other users.

## Uploading a project

Creating a project is easy. After getting the data of interest in the scratchpad project in [workspace](workspace.md),
click _upload_ in the toolbar, and choose who you want to share the project with.

Or, if you are editing an existing project, click _save_ to save your changes.

Use _share_ button in the top right corner or context menu to edit permissions to access your project.
Sharing a project you automatically share all entities and data inside.

## Filtering

You can use these fields to filter projects with [smart search](smart-search.md):
