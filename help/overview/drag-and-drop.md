# Drag-and-Drop

Datagrok lets almost all objects be drag-and-dropped, which makes a lot of interactions more intuitive.
As soon as a user starts dragging an object, all possible drop zones get highlighed.

Notable uses:

* [Variables view](variables-view.md)
* Columns 
  * Rearrange grid column order (drag by the grid column header)
  * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog
  * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog
