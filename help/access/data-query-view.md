# Query View

An integrated environment for working with [data queries](data-query.md).

To run query, press F5. Results will appear at the bottom of the screen.
Switch to the "Transformations" tab to add post-processing steps if needed.

Give it a name, and save the query to use it later. 

Typically, a query is used against a database, however the same concepts
apply for other data sources that are listed below:

| Data source          | Query      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Relational databases | SQL        |
| File share           | File name  |
| Excel file           | Sheet name |
| Linked data          | SPARQL     |
| Box                  | File name  |
