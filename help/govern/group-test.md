# Tests: Group Management

User [group](../entities/group.md) allow you to flexible configure user rights. [Users](user.md) can request membership 
in [groups](../entities/group.md), start chat with other members, view [group](../entities/group.md) members and etc.

## Testing scenarios

1. Open ```Groups``` from ```Admin``` menu

1. Click on ```New group``` button
   * "Create new [group](../entities/group.md)" dialog is open

1. Click ```OK``` (without filling fields)
   * Warning "Group name is empty"
   * New [group](../entities/group.md) was not created    
     
1. Enter "test" in "Name" field and then click ```OK```
   * New [group](../entities/group.md) was created with name "test"

1. Open "Edit" dialog for "test" [group](../entities/group.md). (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md))
   * Editing dialog is open. Here you can change name and description of [group](../entities/group.md)

1. Open "Edit members" dialog for "test" [group](../entities/group.md). (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md))
   * "Edit members" dialog is open
   * In list of [group](../entities/group.md) members only current user (who created [group](../entities/group.md)) with admin role

1. Click on "admin" label near the username
   * User role is switched to "user" and display accordingly
   
1. Click ```Save``` button 
   * Warning "[group](../entities/group.md) should have at least one admin"  
   
1. Switch role back to "Admin"

1. Start typing user name in search field
   * Drop-down list shows the users found
   * If found user is not in [group](group.md), you can add it (next to user name will be button ```+``` )
   * If found user is already a [group](group.md) member you can change its role or delete it from [group](group.md) 

1. Start typing name of another [group](group.md) in search field
   * You can add one [group](group.md) to another
   * All users belonging to nested [group](group.md) get role and rights that are given to this 
     [group](group.md) within the parent [group](group.md)
   * Group Management as member of another [group](group.md) is similar to managing users in [groups](group.md)

1. Add one user and one [group](group.md) to "test" [group](group.md)

1. Change your role to "user", and roles of other members to "admin"

1. Click on delete user icon next to user name ( ```X``` ) of another user in "Edit members" dialog, then click ```SAVE``` button
   * User was not deleted
   * Warning massage "Insufficient privileges"

   * You left the group "test"

1. Request membership in "test" [group](group.md). (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md))
   * Balloon with information about successful request
   * All admins and members of nested groups with admin role received a notification about request
   * User's notification displays this request with current status (```?``` - pending request, ```x``` - rejected request, ```âœ“``` - request accepted)

1. Open "Edit memberships" dialog for "test" [group](group.md). (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab 
   on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md), it is necessary to do from user with admin role in this group)
   * "Edit memberships" dialog is open
   * In this dialog you can request membership of current group in other groups
   * Management in this dialog is similar to others, but carried out from the position of nested group

1. Open "Chat" for "test" [group](group.md). (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md))

1. Delete "test" [group](group.md) (From contex menu or from "Actions" tab on [Property Panel](../features/property-panel.md))
