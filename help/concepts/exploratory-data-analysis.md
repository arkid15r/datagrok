# Exploratory Data Analysis

*From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis): 
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach 
to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual 
methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing 
what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. 
Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians 
to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data 
collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA),
which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting 
and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of 
variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.* 

From the ground up, Datagrok has been designed to enable interactive exploratory 
data analysis on big datasets. [Importing data](../features/importing-data.md) is 
seamless and fast. Multiple interactive tools exist for the 
[data cleanup and preparation](../features/data-wrangling.md). A rich set 
of [high-performance](performance.md), interactive [viewers](../viewers/viewers.md) 
let you filter and visualize data in any possible way; some of them directly support 
EDA-related features such as [regression lines](../viewers/scatter-plot.md#regression-line), 
or [hypothesis testing](../viewers/box-plot.md#t-test). A number of pre-defined statistical
[functions](../entities/function.md) can be used for calculations. If that is not
enough, new functions can be developed in [R, Python, or Julia](../features/scripting.md). 

Each of the above-mentioned steps can be [automated](../entities/function.md#macros), and 
used in [pipelines](../entities/data-pipeline.md). Sharing the results, obtained either
interactively or through a pipeline, is easy and [secure](../features/security.md).
