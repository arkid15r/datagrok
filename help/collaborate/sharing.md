# Sharing

Many types of objects within the Datagrok platform can be shared with other users or [groups](../govern/group.md). Such shareable objects are called [entities](../overview/objects.md). When an object is shared, you are essentially granting a [privilege](../govern/authorization.md) (typically, 'view' or 'edit') to a grantee. See the [Security](../govern/security.md) article for details on how to manage groups and privileges.

## Sharing Connections and Queries

Access rights of a database connection inherit access rights of a query. However, access rights of the query don't inherit access rights of the database connection. Thus, if one shares a query, the associated database connection shall automatically be shared. At the same time, when you are sharing a database connection, your queries aren't going to be shared automatically.

As for web queries, they are automatically shared along with sharing the corresponding connection.
