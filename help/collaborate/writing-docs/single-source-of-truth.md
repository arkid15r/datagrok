# Single source of truth

Our wiki is a single source of truth for any information about how to deploy, use, or troubleshoot Datagrok. This policy
applies to how we communicate and share knowledge internally and externally. The rationale is simple. We want to have
all information about Datagrok in a place that is universally accessible to prevent information silos, knowledge gaps,
and inefficiencies.

For this reason, we maintain our documentation in a [public repository on
Github](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/help). To learn how to contribute, see [Contribute to
docs](link).

We encourage anyone to share their knowledge through a wiki article, a post on a [community
forum](https://community.datagrok.ai/), or a YouTube video. The more information we add, the more we help others
accomplish tasks faster and better and solve problems.
