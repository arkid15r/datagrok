## Titles

We use [sentence-style capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/text-formatting/using-type/use-sentence-style-capitalization) for headers and articles' names:

* **Not correct**: Building Custom Information Panels
* **Correct**: Building custom information panels

## Proper names

We capitalize proper names of distinct UI functional elements:

* **Not correct**: Navigate to a property panel
* **Acceptable**: Navigate to the Property Panel 
* **Correct**: Navigate to Property Panel
    
We don't capitalize functional elements which can exist in plurality:

* **Not correct**: Open Information Panel
* **Correct**: Open an information panel, in the information panel select an item
