# Adding New Columns

Adds a column of the specified type to the current table, and initializes it using the specified
expression (mathematical function, constants, platform objects properties and functions).

To reference a column, specify its name in the curly brackets, preceded by the dollar sign, like
that: ${WIDTH}. While editing the formula, press '$' to opens up a column list popup; use arrows and
Enter to select it.

For formulas where row index is required, 'row' variable is available.

Examples:
```
1.57 * ${WEIGHT} / ${HEIGHT}
-log(${IC50} * LN10)
```

To treat data as strings use quotes, for example: 
```
"a" + "b"
```
results in "ab".

Detection of datetime for most datetime formats works automatically. 
But in some cases it is hard to recognize is it formula or datetime.
For example to get "1/1/2019" date, to solve this set datetime type and use quotes:
```
"1/1/2019"
```
