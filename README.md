# Datagrok package repository

This is a public repository for [packages](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) 
available for the [Datagrokâ„¢](https://datagrok.ai) platform, 
curated by the Datagrok team. It contains different scientific methods integrated with the platform, 
as well as custom viewers, application, and functions.

Organizations that deploy Datagrok on their premises can access public packages. In addition to that,
they might establish their own private repositories (most likely on their premises on the virtual private
cloud) that would contain their proprietary applications built on top of the platform.
